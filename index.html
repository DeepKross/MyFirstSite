        <h3 id="eco">Eco issues, eco home.</h3>

            <p>Hello, and today I am going to talk about the topic that is extremely burning today. And that`s ecological
                issues that our world faces every day. A vital majority of all the problems are caused by human beings and
                that is a matter of fact. So, let`s discuss some points about the issue that our planet faces today.</p>
        <p>Firtly, the highest ecological problem today is <strong>Global Warming.</strong> Global warming refers to the phenomenon of gradual
            <em>temperature rise</em> of atmosphere, soil, water and vegetative cover on Earth’s surface year by year, major
            cause of which is <em>greenhouse effect</em> due to emission of such greenhouse gases (GHG)
               as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). With the accelerated industrialization and
               urbanization after the nineteenth century, CO2 concentration started the process of escalation
               at faster and faster speed. Since the Industrial Revolution, the average air temperature of the
               globe has increased by about 0.7 °C and is increasing at the speed of 0.2 °C every 10 years. Global warming
               has far-reaching influence on the world, such as rise of sea level, submergence of some foreland regions,
               etc.; global warming will cause precipitation change and abnormal climate, damage to the ecosystem
               cousing droughts and floods, threaten both the production and daily
               life of humankind and trigger diseases related to heat wave.</p>
            <p> The second but not less important is <strong>Sharp Decrease of Forest Cover</strong> Forest is an important
                ecological resource having effects of air purification, adjusting climate, water conservation,
                resisting wind and promoting ecological stability.
                At the infancy of human civilization, the virgin forest on the globe covered two thirds of the continent,
                reaching 76 million km2; in the mid-nineteenth century, the covered area was 56 million km2; by the end
                of twentieth century, the area was reduced to 34.4 million km2, coverage falling to 27 %; and in 2003,
                the forest cover area was left as some 28 million km2. It is obvious that since the Industrial Revolution
                in the eighteenth century, the global forest cover has been seriously damaged. Reduction of forest cover
                has brought about severe adverse impact on the global ecosystem, causing water loss and soil erosion and
                land desertification, damaging biological diversity, intensifying greenhouse effect and threatening the
                sustainable development of human society.</p>
            <p> So the matter is to save our planet. We are the first generation to know we’re destroying the world, and we
                could be the last that can do anything about it. Speaking up is one of the most powerful things you can
                do especially if it’s to the right people. </p>
        <p> One of the most efficient ways of lowering your environmental
            impact is by <em>travelling responsibly</em>. Transport is one of the most polluting sectors.
                This means, whenever you can, choosing a more sustainable way to get
                from A to B - walk or cycle when you can. Farming animals for meat and dairy
                requires space and huge inputs of water and feed. Today, one of the biggest causes of forest loss is the
                expansion of agricultural land for animal feed production, such as soy.</p>

        <h3 id="eSecurity">Internet security</h3>
        <strong>Key words: </strong> <em>intrusion - вторгнення,fraud -шахрайство, обман, malicious software- шкідливе програмне забезпечення
            malicious intent - злий намір
        </em>
        <p>Hello, and today I am gonna talk about the topic that is extremely burning today. That`s security in the Internet.
            Data security digs into data protection and privacy compliance, explaining how to construct a proactive
            security strategy strengthened by best practices. Data security is one of the most important tasks for IT
            professionals. Each year, companies of all sizes spend a sizable portion of their IT security budgets
            protecting their organizations from hackers intent on gaining access to data through brute force, exploiting
            vulnerabilities or social engineering.<em> Here are some technologies widely used by enterprises to protect data.</em></p>
        <p>When people communicate with each other over the Internet everything they do is passed along a string of
            computers that are all linked together. So for example say you were writing an e-mail letter to a friend,
            when you click on send it is not transferred directly to that person's computer. The file first goes to your
            particular server then to another computer and so on until it reaches the destination server and finally
            it`s in friend`s computer.</p>
        <p>One of the most basic concepts of data security is <strong>encryption</strong>, as simply encrypting sensitive data can go a long
            way toward meeting privacy  and keeping sensitive information safe from hackers.
            The most common form of encryption -- symmetric -- involves converting plaintext to ciphertext using the same
            key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses two independent keys -- one to encrypt the
            data and one to decrypt it. And that`s a most commonly used way of preventing the leak of info.</p>
        <p><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls act as filters that protect devices by allowing or denying access to a network. By applying
            a specific set of rules to identify if something is safe or harmful, firewalls can prevent sensitive
            information from being stolen.</p>
        <p> There are a lot of other ways to keep the data secure but the main idea of reaching the goal is making
            personal way for a company or particular users. Anyway, that`s a highly important topic for us as a programmers
            and everyone should get into this topic as clear as the one can, and make the data security as perfect as it is
            possible</p>

        <h3 id="eDevelopment">Brief history of the Internet development</h3>
        <p>And now I am going to talk about a history of Inventing the Internet. The internet was the work of dozens of
            scientists, programmers and engineers who each developed new features and technologies that eventually merged
            to become the “information Web” we know it today. Everyone would agree with me if I say that noone can imagine
            the todays world without the Net. Even the info for preparing this topic was taken nowhere but the Internet.
            So who was the Inventor of such an extremely vital thing of today.</p>
        <p> Nikola Tesla toyed with the idea of a “world wireless system” in the early 1900s, and visionary thinkers like
            Paul Otlet and Vannevar Bush conceived of mechanized, searchable storage systems of books and media
            in the 1930s and 1940s. Still, the first practical schematics for the internet would not arrive until
            the early 1960s, when MIT’s J.C.R. Licklider popularized the idea of an “Intergalactic Network” of computers.
            Shortly thereafter, computer scientists developed the concept of “packet switching,” a method for effectively
            transmitting electronic data that would later become one of the major building blocks of the internet.</p>
        <p> <em>The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, or
            the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET
            used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network. </em></p>
        <p> The technology continued to grow in the 1970s after scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed
            Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, a communications model that set standards for
            how data could be transmitted between multiple networks. </p>
        <p>The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented
            the World Wide Web. While it’s often confused with the internet itself, the web is actually just the most common
            means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks.</p>
        <p> The web helped popularize the internet among the public, and served as a crucial step in developing the vast
            trove of information that most of us now access on a daily basis.</p>
        <p> And that`s the most important brief info about creating a Global Web. That was a big and long story to be real
            which included the minds of many genius people and their efforts and what a big result we received.</p>

        <h3 id="health">Health. Symptoms and how to bounce back. Telemedicine</h3>
        <strong>Key words:</strong> <em>runny nose, Fever - гарячка, in a good shape,  </em>
        <p>There are a lot of problems humanity faces today and the world is going through rapid changes, and the only
            constant thing that is in our hands is our health. Being healthy is a choice. Specific guidelines are there
            to maintain good health, but in the end, it is individual effort and determination. Health can be of varied
            types; physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual.</p>
        <p> Mental health refers to our emotional and psychological well-being. Mental health has a significant impact on
            our thoughts, behaviors, and attitude. It is essential to give equal attention to our mental health as its
            effects are grave. Teenagers are very susceptible to depression and anxiety as they go through the troubled
            adolescent period. Cutting off toxic people is the right way of having better mental health.</p>
        <p>Getting plenty of rest is arguably the most important strategy when it comes to bouncing back from an illness.
            Aim to add at least an extra hour to your normal sleep time whenever you feel illness creeping in,
            either by going to bed earlier or sleeping in later. Drink more water! Fluids need to be replenished for the
            body to maintain optimum function. When our bodies are fighting off illness, they need all the help they can
            get. Much of that help can come in the form of what we put into our bodies. And try to stay positive—while it’s
            easy to fall into the self-pitying doldrums when you’re sick, that doesn’t do anything for your vitality.
            Instead, remind yourself that common illnesses such as the cold and flu are temporary, and soon enough this
            period of sickness will be just a distant memory. </p>
        <p>Telemedicine is a general term that covers all of the ways you and your doctor can use technology to communicate
            without being in the same room. It includes phone calls, video chats, emails, and text messages. Using
            telemedicine as an alternative to in-person visits has a host of benefits for patients and providers alike.</p>
        <p><strong>Patients enjoy:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Less time away from work</li>
                <li>No travel expenses or time</li>
                <li>Less interference with child or elder care responsibilities</li>
                <li>Privacy</li>
                <li>No exposure to other potentially contagious patients</li>
            </ul>
        <p>    <strong>Providers enjoy:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Increased revenue</li>
                <li>Improved office efficiency</li>
                <li>An answer to the competitive threat of retail health clinics and on-line only providers</li>
                <li>Better patient follow through and improved health outcomes</li>
                <li>Fewer missed appointments and cancellations</li>
                <li>Private payer reimbursement</li>

        <h3 id="eSurveillance">The Internet surveillance.</h3>
        <p>Is Big Brother watching you or is it just your paranoia and you’re imagining things? Unfortunately, while you
            may think that you’re not interesting enough for someone to spy on you or monitor your online activities – you
            are and you’re being a victim of Internet surveillance every second you spend online. Unfortunately, while you
            may think that you’re not interesting enough for someone to spy on you or monitor your online activities – you
            are and you’re being a victim of Internet surveillance every second you spend online.</p>
        <p>Internet, or online surveillance, is the act of monitoring and logging your Internet traffic by a third party.
            This could be government agencies, corporations, cybercriminals, or someone else. In fact, nine leading online
            corporations have publicly gone on record about relaying customer data to gov. agencies, in particular, the NSA
            (National Security Agency) and that they were legally required to do this by the PRISM program. Another way
            agencies can track you is by using the data from cell towers. In this case, cellphone providers are legally
            required to collect this data and surrender it to the NSA when they receive a court order.</p>
        <p>As you probably know already, when you visit websites, they will store a small piece of data on your computer,
            known as cookies. These are small files that contain information about your device, how you browse and so on.</p>
        <p>How to protect yourself from government surveillance? A VPN, or a Virtual Private Network, is an online service
            that encrypts your Internet traffic and hides your IP address. So if you are worried about your traffic being
            monitored by anyone, a good way to prevent them from doing so is by using a VPN service. Turn off Location
            Services on Your Phone and that`s an extremely important nowadays due to the last doings in our country</p>
        <p>Today every laptop or smartphone comes with a camera. And they’re not just for taking selfies. Unfortunately,
            your webcam can be your worst enemy without you even knowing as the state can hack your camera and your
            microphone and spy on you. I have recently watched the serial called CyberStalker where the main character
            hacked the cameras of some students he didn`t like and received a pretty much of info about them and it showed that
            little light doesn`t always show if your camera is on. </p>
        <p> Finally, none of the tools and the technology here will matter against online surveillance if you are being
            irresponsible with what you do on the Internet. Avoid sharing too much info online, like on social media,
            especially your sensitive information.</p>

        <h3 id="cryptoNencrypto">Cryptography. Encryption</h3>
        <strong>Cezar script, shift=3</strong>
        <p>Hello, and today I am gonna talk about the topic that is extremely burning today. Each year, companies of all
            sizes spend a sizable portion of their IT security budgets protecting their organizations from hackers intent
            on gaining access to data through brute force, exploiting vulnerabilities or social engineering.That`s
            security in the Internet. </p>
        <p>Cryptography is way you can keep information secure. A person who does not know the method used to change the
            information to keep it secure cannot copy the method used or reverse the change. The basic components of
            cryptographic systems are used to encipher (scramble) information so that it is difficult to determine the
            meaning without the appropriate key or key(s) to decipher (unscramble) the information. The components include
            cryptographic algorithms (mathematical functions) for enciphering or deciphering information and keys.</p>
        <p>Symmetric and asymmetric are two examples of cryptographic systems. Symmetric systems use the same key to
            encipher and decipher. Asymmetric systems generate and use different keys to encipher and decipher a secure
            key pair. With this key pair, consisting of a public key and a private key, only one key can decipher what the
            other enciphers. Merely knowing one key does not make it very likely that someone will be able to figure
            out the other key.</p>
        <p> How Encryption Works
            For data communicated over a network, modern encryption scrambles data using a secret value or key known only by
            the recipient and the sender. For stored data, the secret value is typically known only by the data owner.
            There are different types of encryption and the best systems balance safety and efficiency. Here are just a few
            of the places where you likely use encryption in your everyday life:</p>
        <ul>
            <strong>Web browsing</strong>
                <li>Browsers and websites use HTTPS, an encrypted protocol, to provide secure communications, keeping our data
                from being read by bad actors while in transit.</li>
            <strong>E-commerce</strong>
            <li>We trust companies to protect our financial information when we buy things online or use online banking.
                Encryption is an important method of doing that.</li>
            <strong>Secure messaging</strong>
            <li>When we use a messaging app, we expect the messages to be private. Some messaging apps use encryption to
                maintain the privacy and security of their users’ communications while it is in transit. Others even use
                end-to-end encryption, so only the sender and receiver can read the messages.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>Encryption safeguards the personal security of billions of people and the national security of countries
                around the world. Here’s why encryption is vital: Personal security
                Encryption is more important than ever as Internet-based crime is one of the fastest growing security
                threats. End-to-end encryption, the most secure form of encryption, ensures that sensitive, confidential
                information transmitted by billions of people online every day remains confidential and out of the hands
                of criminals. End-to-end encryption helps prevent spies, terrorists, and hostile governments from accessing
                and exploiting confidential communications of government officials, and penetrating computer systems and
                databases that could cause wide-scale, systemic disruptions to economies, infrastructure, and security. </p>

        <h3 id="robots">Robots and robotics. Agility robots. Labour-saving gadgets: pros and cons.</h3>
            <p>Today the world faces an issue about robots and that everything can be replaced by them. Robot is a mechanical
                technological device that performs automated tasks that either work by following direct supervision from
                human being, a set program, or general guidelines that are well defined through the use of artificial
                intelligence techniques. The tasks performed by robots either replace or improve on human work and can be
                used in manufacturing companies, constructions places or even in the manipulation of heavy materials.
                robots have been set in away that perform tasks similar to human beings; this has led to the replacement
                of human labor in different simple repetitive activities.</p>
            <p>Robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do,
                or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer
                space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in
                society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing
                numbers of functions.</p>
        <p><strong>Agility robots key words:</strong> Can help blind ppl. Can serve as a servants or in any other sphere of services.
                Come in handy to disabled ppl: bring beer, cook meal. In some way they can be a babysitters. Can be a
                testers for some dangerous purposes. They can be pets).</p>
            <p> <strong>Pros:</strong>The use of machines make office work to be more systematic
            and neat. Thus, the <em>quality of work</em> is improved because of machines. Machine ensures <em>accuracy</em>
            in office work because the bottlenecks and delays in work are eliminated and the work runs smoothly. The chances
            of errors and frauds are reduced on the use of machine. The use of machine facilitates <em>completion of work
                in time.</em> The works which took hours to complete are done within no time with the help of machine.
            The timely completion of work increases the efficiency of the worker which in turn helps increased profitability. .
            <em>Minimisation of Cost</em></p>
        <p><strong>cons:</strong> The installation cost of machines are high because it involves <em>huge amount of money.</em>
            It ensures blocking of large part of capital and it becomes beyond the capacity of small firms to go
            for mechanization.<em>When a new machine comes, the old one becomes useless.</em><em> Hostile workers/</em>
            The <em>cost of breakdown</em>
            of a machine is heavy to the organization. It will cause a considerably disruption in
            office work on account of breakdown.

        <p>AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal
            assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.</p>
        <p>Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs.
            RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing
            transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people
            used to do.RPA offers plenty of career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst,
            solution architect and consultant. And these jobs pay well.</p>
        <p>Cloud data, safe storage of data and info etc...</p>
        <p>Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of
            quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also involved
            in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily
            query, monitor, analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is
            finding applications is banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud
            detection. End of passwords.</p>
        <p>VR immerses the user in an environment while AR enhances their environment. Although this technology trend has
            primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with VirtualShip, a simulation
            software used to train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship captains.</p>

        <h3 id="PCvsMAC">PC vs Mac</h3>
        <p>This topic is the one that people nowadays can`t solve for years. Some says that PC and Android are the best
        while others insist on another option - Mac and IOS. So many minds - so many thoughts, so I will try to use a
        language of facts to show all the pros and cons and at the end tell my personal view on this debate I what I
            do prefer.</p>
        <p>Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the two main computer systems come from the operating systems.
            OS X® and Microsoft® Windows® work differently. Depending on what you want to do, one might be better than
            the other, but it comes down to what you are comfortable with. Apple® products are designed to work together,
            and Windows and Android™ products are designed to work together, along with PlayStation® and Xbox®. Some people
            dislike the extra work to get the different devices to talk to each other. Apple tightly controls the software
            on its devices, there is much less bloatware installed on new systems.Macs tend to have new innovations
            incorporated into their design faster than PCs.The biggest PC advantage is cost. Because there are so many PC
            makers, it is possible to find a wide range of devices at different price points. Only the most high-powered
            and expensive PCs approach Apple products’ price point.</p>

        <p>Although Apple is trying to catch up, PCs have more opportunities for touch screens. With Windows 8 and
            Windows 10 created with touch screens in mind; laptops can convert to tablets, desktops can use touch screen
            monitors, and tablets can be used like computers. PCs are more easily upgraded and have more options for
            different components. A Mac, if it’s upgradeable, can upgrade only memory and the storage drive. A PC user can
            select from many motherboards, processors, storage drives, video cards, graphics cards, audio cards,
            and memory. This enables PC users to build a custom machine, or upgrade an existing machine quickly
            and easily.</p>
        <p>It’s certainly possible to run games on a Mac, but PCs are generally considered better for hard-core gaming.
        The Mac vs PC debate will continue as long as they are the two major choices for hardware and operating systems.
        Each system does some things better; it’s really a matter of what features are important to you and what you’re
        going to use the computer for. Whatever you choose, enjoy it!</p>
        <p>As for me, I can certainly say that I do prefer a Apple production. But there is a issue that I can`t afford
            MacBook due to it`s huge cost. And that`s a big problem for me.<em>I have Iphone...One of my goals is buying a
                MacBook...I don`t play games...Programing is very convenient on Mac products... Android phones are too bad...
                Pc are not that bad....</em>

        <h3 id="movies">Movie Villains and Heroes their features expressed by adverbs and adjectives</h3>
        <p>It`s quite a philosophical issue to determine what makes hero a hero and villain a villain.
    That is hard to tell exactly because that is just an idea of a author. I personally do like some villains
            as personalities for some reasons and dislike some heroes for anything. So let`s discuss this a little bit deeper.</p>
        <p>When you hear the word hero, do you think of someone with super human strength? Of course not. That is a matter
            personality to say that the person is a hero. <em>too hyperbolic</em> A hero is selfless, a genuinely good
            person, and someone gets the undivided attention of all of us and causes change. Someone willing to risk their
            own life to save another. I have no doubt that there are real heroes not just in movies...</p>
        <p>Sarah Perry says, "A hero is a person who saves the day. He's the one who has all the courage and he has
            responsibility." and that`s right... But not all movie heroes can be called real heroes...
            The great example is Spider-man from the last movie.<em>He had no responsibility...Caused a lot of problems
                of his selfish ideas and ideals... I mean< not everu man in a suit that says he is going to save the world
                is a real hero..</em>.</p>
        <p>What about villains?A villain is the opposite of a hero. A villain is the antagonist of your story whose
            motivations and actions oppose the protagonist and drive the plot of your story. A villain is the opposite of
            a hero. In contrast to the hero, a villain is usually compelled by a desire to commit acts of cruelty and
            immorality. The best villains are inextricably connected to the hero, and aid in the hero’s character
            development through their inherent opposition to them. For example, in the Harry Potter series, Lord Voldemort
            murdered Harry Potter’s parents when he was a child. Every villain needs to have his own morality. If a villain
            spends part your story killing people, you need to give him or her believable reasons for doing so. Make the
            reader understand exactly what desperation or belief has driven him to it.</p>
        <p>But there are a lot of examples when, to my mind, the villain acts as he is a hero themself. In some
            stories they have such a good lor that you feel the ideas and ideals of a villain and completely understand the reasons
            why he or she is doing so.<em>The great example is film Joker...</em></p>

        <h3 id="ai">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p><em>I want to connect my future profession with AI</em>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of
            human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may
            also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as
            learning and problem-solving. I think that AI is our near future. So let`s discuss this issue a little bit deeper
        </p>
        <p>The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the
            best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is <strong>machine learning</strong>
            , which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data
            without being assisted by humans. <strong>Deep learning</strong>techniques enable this automatic learning through the
            absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video. All those 2 techniques are main
            parts of understanding and creating an AI.</p>
        <p>When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's
            because films show us AI this way. But nothing could be further from the truth.The goals of artificial
            intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making
            surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent
            that these can be concretely defined.</p>
        <p>The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the
            healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures
            in the operating room. Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play
            chess and self-driving cars.Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it
            is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account
            deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. <em>In trading</em></p>
        <p><strong>Problems of AI</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They can become to high developed</li>
            <li>Rights of robots</li>

        <h3 id="GenZ">Generation Z</h3>
        <p>Generation Z refers to the generation born between 1997-2012, following millennials. This generation has been
            raised on the internet and social media. Gen Z most closely mirrors millennials on key social and political
            issues, but without much of the optimism.The average Gen Z got their first smartphone just before their
            12 birthday. They communicate primarily through social media and texts, and spend as much time on their
            phones as older generations do watching television. The oldest of this generation are reaching 25 years of
            age, with many now out of college, getting married, and starting families.</p>
    <p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine, members of Gen Z face a future more uncertain than
        many previous generations. While past generations have taken up social issues, Gen Z are more social-minded than
        previous generations. Gen Zers are focused on some key social issues: healthcare, mental health,
        higher education, economic security, civic engagement, race equity, and the environment. </p>
    <p>Gen Zers also make education a priority. More than half (57%) of those aged 18 to 21 years old were enrolled at
         college. Gen Z members also are more likely to finish high school. Members of Gen Z are fighting for social
        change, racial equity, and protecting the environment in record numbers.They tend to live more slowly than their
        predecessors when they were their age, have lower rates of teenage pregnancies, and consume alcohol less often.</p>
        <p><strong title="Key phrases">Physical abilities. Lower percent of ppl that are used to living in bad conditions. Children have less
            social time and less friends. All of them are less developed in physical way.</strong></p>

        <h3 id="Cyberspace">Cyberspace</h3>
    <p> “Cyber” refers to anything involving computers or computer networks, such as the Internet. As a
        cyberpsychologist, I study human interactions with technology, digital media, artificial intelligence, mobile
        and networked devices. I also research how the Internet and digital activities, such as gaming and virtual
        reality, affect human behaviour. I focus on Internet psychology and figuring out how technology has the
        potential to impact or change human behaviour. The development of information technology has exploded over
        the past 30 years. We now spend a significant part of our life in a space – cyberspace – that did not exist
        previously. We all know about the incredible benefits of the “information superhighway”’ of cyberspace, the
        Internet: affordability, convenience, connectivity, creativity, altruism, educational and cultural exchange,
        along with the growth of opportunities.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact,  Cyberactivity can have real-world consequences, claims for the independence of
            cyberspace are based on a false statement: physical and virtual are not opposed, but are proven to influence
            one another... In other words, what happens in the cyber ecosystem can affect the real world.
            It is essential for us to examine this new environment to maximise its benefits and avoid potential risk
            and harm.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong>People behave differently when they are interacting with technology, compared to interacting face-to-face
            with the real world: Whenever technology interfaces with a base human tendency, the result is amplification
            and acceleration. We have all experienced technology-mediated adverse psychological effects, from smartphone
            addictive-type behaviours to being subjected to social technology “weapons of mass distraction” that take
            our attention. And then harvest, profile, micro-target, monetise and subliminally manipulate us online.</p>
        <p>The scientific study of cyberspace began in the early 1990s. Researchers attempted to analyse and predict
            human behaviour mediated by technology, but these attempts were only partially successful. Very often
            findings concerning specific types of behaviours could not be described and explained by traditional
            psychological theory when applied in technology-mediated environments. Now, as we delve even deeper into
            cyberspace, difficulties with some fundamentals of psychology are becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
